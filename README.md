## Moved to Codeberg

This repository has now been moved to [my Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ryanrobinson/drupal-module-h5p-views).

## Overview

This module extends [h5p for Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/project/h5p) to improve support for using the H5P Library Type in views, both in viewing as a field and with a dropdown exposed filter that only shows types which have content.
